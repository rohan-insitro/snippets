# Review of Derivative Rules 

We start with an introduction to a new notation:  

The notation $$f: A \rightarrow B$$ means “$$f$$ is a function taking input from $$A$$ and producing output in $$B$$” where $$A$$ and $$B$$ are sets. In other words, $$A$$ is the domain and $$B$$ is the range. 

We are all familiar with scalar-valued functions (i.e. $$xy$$-cartesian plotted functions): 

$$
f: \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R} 
$$

We will study derivatives of scalar-valued functions (i.e. single-variable).

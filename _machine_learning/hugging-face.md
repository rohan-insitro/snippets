# Hugging Face 

Hugging Face is a popular ML platform that aims to be the Github for ML. It allows users to upload models, datasets, spaces (Browser demo's), inference API's, all with version control. 
The two main components of HF are the "Transformers" library and the "Hub". Here we describe some notes about the latter (Hub). 

## Models 

The core part of the Hub. Here, you can deploy your own custom models (with weights) to the hub. Visibility can be private, public, or organization.
